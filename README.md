Gotilla
=======

The `gotilla` package provides a collection of Go utilities for common tasks.

Go is a small language which is useful from a development and maintenance
perspective but it can result in common tasks being more verbose than other 
languages where there are more productivity methods. The `gotilla` package's
goal is to provide wrappers for common tasks in the same spirit of `io/ioutil`
to make programming Go a bit faster.

In terms of scope, `gotilla` is designed to cover all common areas.
